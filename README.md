# Can I submit an article with javascript to The Atlantic?

*Hello Frankie and Chris*,

I'm a web developer writing an article about internet pioneer [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson).

I'm wondering whether I **can use javascript as part of my article submission?**

For my article, I wrote a custom jQuery plugin in an attempt to demonstrate how hypertext would be different had Ted Nelson succeeded instead of [Tim Berners-Lee](https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/).

Why contact you?
-----------------
I'm contacting you because I saw that *The Atlantic* developed a n-level [footnoting system for the David Foster Wallace article](https://github.com/theatlantic/host). My project is similar, but it is centered around Ted Nelson's hypertext vision.

###My Javascript Library

The javascript library I created is a **custom citation tool** that allows **authors to demonstrate the context of their citations**. I created a [demo site](http://www.neotext.net/demo/) for it that shows how to expand the quotations when the quotations are clicked. You can view 2 videos on the demo page to get a sense of how my code works and **play around with sample citations** located below the first video.

###demo:

###Neotext components:
The custom citation tool I created includes:

  * a [django generation backend](https://github.com/neotext/neotext-django-server),
  * an [jquery plugin](https://github.com/neotext/neotext-quote-context), and
  * an [optional wordpress plugin](https://github.com/neotext/neotext-wordpress).
  
The code is all **MIT-licensed** and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/neotext/).

Even if the editors don't accept my article, *The Atlantic* is free to use Neotext for other articles.

Next Steps
-----------
If you want to get up to speed quickly by running a document with a sample citation,  **view the [second video](http://www.neotext.net/demo/#sample-code)** and download the code example.

My article has more javascript than just Neotext citations, but I want to begin by asking whether it **is possible to use my Neotext jQuery plugin with the article I plan to submit**?

If you say yes, I'll share the whole article with you so you can see the full javascript (the article is in its own private github repository).

**P.S.** I've tried contacting you by email, voicemail, and twitter.  I'm hoping I have better luck with Github.
